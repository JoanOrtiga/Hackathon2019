# Hackathon 2019

This app was made in 32 hours in Hackaton Jam, organized by Tecnocampus.

Theme was: "Do something for Matar√≥",

What we thought was making an app where people could upload their stories that have lived  in the city, but also put the important monuments and places to visit for tourists.

As you can see in the photos, you can login and get some personal info and routes.

Monetitzation came from putting brands and shops in the routes of this monuments and stories.

We used OpenSource Maps, Html, javascript and css for the app interface and Apache for local server.
